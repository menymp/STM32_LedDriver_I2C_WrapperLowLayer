# STM32_LedDriver_I2C_WrapperLowLayer
i2c wrapper for led pwm driver PCA9685


PCA9685 I2C led pwm driver library development for HAL or LL libraries with STM32.

The selected test board was STM32F334R8 nucleo with CubeMx as init tool and Atollic truestudio as IDE.

The wrapper is compatible with Low Layer library and HAL library with the HAL_DRIVER define in PCA9685.h header file.
